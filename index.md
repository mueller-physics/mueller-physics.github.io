Hi, I am Marcel, post-doc, physicist, working on super-resolved fluorescence microscopy. This is an overview page for my projects, and so somewhat of a CV.

## The fairSIM project

My main project is an open-source reconstruction software for structured illumination microscopy (SIM), found at
[fairsim.org](http://www.fairsim.org). All code is hosted [here on github](https://github.com/fairsim), including
a manual and test datasets.
There is also a publication here in [Nature Communications](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160321/ncomms10980/abs/ncomms10980.html) (open access).

We are currently working on combining fairSIM with a home-built, 2D SIM microscope system, and are in the last stages of drafting an accompanying publication.

## Bielefeld Biophysics

I also maintain the github [project page](https://github.com/biophotonics-bielefeld) of the [Biomolecular Photonics group](http://www.physik.uni-bielefeld.de/biopho) at Bielefeld University,
and implemented the Java / ImageJ-plugins hosted there.

## Some side projects

* A low-cost, Arduino-based electric [microscope stage heater](https://mueller-physics.github.io/arduino-stage-heater).
