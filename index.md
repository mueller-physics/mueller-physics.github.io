description: super-resolution microscopy
---

Hi, I am Marcel Müller, a post-doctoral research working on software & instruments
for super-resolved fluorescence microscopy.

## The fairSIM project

My main research focus is structured illumination microscopy (SIM). My _fairSIM_ project
([www.fairsim.org](https://www.fairsim.org)) provides open-source software 
([publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10980),[code](https://www.github.com/fairSIM/fairSIM)),
an integrated, multi-color, video-rate SIM microscope providing real-time
reconstruction 
([publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12165-x),
[code](https://www.github.com/fairSIM/fairSIM-VIGOR), 
[datasets](https://zenodo.org/record/2649890))
and novel, multi-planar detection schemes ([preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/773440)).

## Bespoke & cost-effective super-resolution systems

I also contribute to the development and implementation of cost-effective super-resolution systems.

* Evaluation of an industry-grade CMOS cameras for dSTORM / localization microscopy 
([publicaion](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-14762-6), [device adapter code](https://github.com/biophotonics-bielefeld/ids-device-adapter)).

* Comparison of sCMOS, emCCD and industry-grade CMOS cameras for 
SOFI ([publication](https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7647/ab36ae), [datasets](https://zenodo.org/record/3341781)).

## Bielefeld Biophysics

I maintain the github [project page](https://github.com/biophotonics-bielefeld) of the [Biomolecular Photonics group](http://www.physik.uni-bielefeld.de/biopho) at Bielefeld University,
and implemented the Java / ImageJ-plugins hosted there:

* [ESI](https://github.com/biophotonics-bielefeld/ESI): A entropy-based super-resolution approach by Idir Yahiatene
* [GICA](https://github.com/biophotonics-bielefeld/GICA): A colocalization analysis approach by Fabian Humpert
* Improvements to the [IDS device adapter](https://github.com/biophotonics-bielefeld/ids-device-adapter) to run IDS uEye
caremas at full speed in MicroManager

## Small (hardware-related) side projects

* A low-cost, Arduino-based electric [microscope stage heater](https://mueller-physics.github.io/arduino-stage-heater).
* Code for [remotely displaying images](https://github.com/mueller-physics/raspberry-network-display) on a Raspberry Pi. This is aimed at using it to control an SLM.
